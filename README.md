# 🌍 WasteEasy – Household Waste-to-Energy Web App

WasteEasy is a clean, intuitive, and educational web application built to demonstrate how everyday household waste can be converted into renewable energy in simple, safe, and effective ways.  

This project was developed under **Problem Statement AVS311 (Software / Web Development)** by **Team Gadget Geeks**.

---

## 🧩 Problem Statement

Household waste has strong potential to generate renewable energy. However, there are **not enough simple and effective solutions** that help people understand:

- how their waste can be processed  
- what type of energy it can generate  
- how to manage waste safely at home  
- how waste segregation impacts sustainability  

Most existing solutions are complex, industrial, or not accessible to everyday users.

---

## 🎯 Purpose of the Project

- To **educate users** on how household waste can be transformed into renewable energy.  
- To **simplify complex waste-to-energy processes** using an interactive web platform.  
- To promote **home-level waste segregation** through clear visual guidance.  
- To strengthen awareness about **sustainable waste management** practices.  
- To show the **environmental impact** of shifting from waste → energy.

## 💡 Our Solution: WasteEasy Web App

We built a **Next.js based web application** that:

- Categorizes waste into simple groups  
- Shows how each category can be processed  
- Explains biogas, composting, recycling, and energy conversion  
- Demonstrates how each waste type contributes to renewable energy  
- Uses a clean, modern interface with simple explanations  
- Helps users understand sustainability in an easy, practical way  

This app is made for **everyone**, regardless of technical background.
